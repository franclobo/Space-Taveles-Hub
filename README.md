# Space Travelers' Hub
In this task, we worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API. Our task is to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application will allow users to book rockets and join selected space missions.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.
- Gitflow.

## Getting Started

The Space Travelers' Hub consists of Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section.

# Rockets

The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking.

# Missions

The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier.

# My Profile

The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.
